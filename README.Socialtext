You might want to set up Dan Bricklin's repo in order to merge changes
from there.

  git remote add dbrick git://github.com/DanBricklin/socialcalc.git
  git fetch dbrick

When you want to integrate Dan's code:

  git fetch dbrick
  git merge dbrick/master

This is preferred over a rebasing pull as it won't require forced pushing
which disrupts already-checked-out trees.
